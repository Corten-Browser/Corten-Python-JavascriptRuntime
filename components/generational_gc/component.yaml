description: High-performance generational garbage collector with young and old generations

dependencies:
  - name: memory_gc
    version: "^0.2.0"
    imports:
      - GarbageCollector
      - HeapObject
  - name: value_system

exports:
  - GenerationalGC
  - YoungGeneration
  - OldGeneration
  - WriteBarrier
  - RememberedSet
  - LargeObjectSpace
  - GCStats

requirements:
  functional:
    - FR-P4-056: Young generation (nursery)
    - FR-P4-057: Old generation (tenured space)
    - FR-P4-058: Minor GC (scavenge young generation)
    - FR-P4-059: Major GC (mark-sweep old generation)
    - FR-P4-060: Write barrier implementation
    - FR-P4-061: Remembered set (cross-generational pointers)
    - FR-P4-062: Object promotion (young → old)
    - FR-P4-063: Allocation in young generation
    - FR-P4-064: Large object space
    - FR-P4-065: GC triggering heuristics
    - FR-P4-066: GC statistics and tuning
    - FR-P4-067: Integration with existing GC

  non_functional:
    - Minor GC pause time <5ms for 8MB young gen
    - Major GC pause time <50ms for 64MB old gen
    - 2-5x throughput improvement over mark-sweep
    - Young generation survival rate <10%

  testing:
    - Minimum 60 unit tests
    - Test coverage ≥85%
    - GC stress tests
    - Integration tests with existing GC
