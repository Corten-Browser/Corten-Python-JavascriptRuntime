    version: "^0.2.0"
  - name: inline_caching
    version: "^0.1.0"
  - name: hidden_classes
    version: "^0.1.0"

requirements:
  - FR-P4-023: Bytecode → machine code compiler
  - FR-P4-024: Register allocation (simple linear scan)
  - FR-P4-025: Code generation for all opcodes
  - FR-P4-026: Call convention implementation
  - FR-P4-027: Stack frame management
