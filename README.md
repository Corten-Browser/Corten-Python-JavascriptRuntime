A not fully tested implementation of a Javascript engine implemented in Python. Why would anyone do that? Ask Claude Code :-) I had Claude generate a complete set of specifications for a web browser written entirely in Rust. For some reason it left out the "Rust" part of the specification, only for the Javascript engine, the one component no one would ever consider writing in Python! Any way, being busy I handed it off to Claude Code which decided this was an educational implementation (despite the spec saying otherwise) and it choose Python. So rather than throw it out, I'm keeping it for anyone who wants to try it or as a warning to keep a closer eye on your LLMs
